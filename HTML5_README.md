Here are some common HTML5 interview questions along with example answers:

### 1. **What is HTML5?**
   **Answer:**  
   HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages. It introduces new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and provides support for multimedia elements like audio and video without requiring third-party plugins. It also improves the semantic structure of web documents and enhances support for web applications.

---

### 2. **What are the new features in HTML5?**
   **Answer:**  
   HTML5 introduces several new features, including:
   - **Semantic elements** like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>`.
   - **Multimedia support** with `<audio>` and `<video>` tags.
   - **Graphics and animations** using `<canvas>` and SVG.
   - **Form enhancements** like new input types (`date`, `email`, `number`, `range`, etc.) and attributes (`placeholder`, `required`, `autofocus`).
   - **Offline and storage capabilities** with LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and IndexedDB.
   - **Geolocation API** for location tracking.
   - **Drag and Drop API** for interactive user interfaces.

---

### 3. **What is the purpose of the `<canvas>` element in HTML5?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `<canvas>` element is used to draw graphics, animations, and other visual content on the fly using JavaScript. It provides a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas for rendering graphs, game graphics, or other visual images dynamically.

   Example:
   ```html
   <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
   <script>
       var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
       var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
       ctx.fillStyle = 'green';
       ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 80);
   </script>
   ```

---

### 4. **What are semantic elements in HTML5?**
   **Answer:**  
   Semantic elements are tags that clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples include:
   - `<header>`: Represents the header of a section or page.
   - `<footer>`: Represents the footer of a section or page.
   - `<article>`: Represents independent, self-contained content.
   - `<section>`: Represents a thematic grouping of content.
   - `<nav>`: Represents a section with navigation links.

   These elements improve the readability and accessibility of the code.

---

### 5. **How does HTML5 support multimedia?**
   **Answer:**  
   HTML5 supports multimedia through the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, which allow embedding audio and video directly into web pages without requiring plugins like Flash. It also supports various codecs and provides APIs for controlling playback.

   Example:
   ```html
   <video width="320" height="240" controls>
       <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
       Your browser does not support the video tag.
   </video>
   ```

---

### 6. **What is the difference between LocalStorage and SessionStorage?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **LocalStorage**: Stores data with no expiration date. The data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
   - **SessionStorage**: Stores data for the duration of a session. The data is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   // LocalStorage
   localStorage.setItem('name', 'John');
   console.log(localStorage.getItem('name')); // Output: John

   // SessionStorage
   sessionStorage.setItem('name', 'Jane');
   console.log(sessionStorage.getItem('name')); // Output: Jane
   ```

---

### 7. **What is the purpose of the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `<figure>` tag is used to encapsulate media content, such as images, diagrams, or code snippets, along with an optional `<figcaption>` tag that provides a caption or description for the content.

   Example:
   ```html
   <figure>
       <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape">
       <figcaption>This is a beautiful landscape.</figcaption>
   </figure>
   ```

---

### 8. **What are the new form elements and attributes in HTML5?**
   **Answer:**  
   HTML5 introduces new form elements and attributes, such as:
   - **New input types**: `date`, `email`, `number`, `range`, `search`, `tel`, `url`, etc.
   - **New attributes**: `placeholder`, `required`, `autofocus`, `pattern`, `min`, `max`, `step`, etc.

   Example:
   ```html
   <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" required>
   <input type="date" min="2023-01-01" max="2023-12-31">
   ```

---

### 9. **What is the purpose of the `<datalist>` element?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `<datalist>` element provides a list of predefined options for an `<input>` element, allowing users to select from a dropdown or type their own value.

   Example:
   ```html
   <input list="browsers">
   <datalist id="browsers">
       <option value="Chrome">
       <option value="Firefox">
       <option value="Safari">
   </datalist>
   ```

---

### 10. **How does HTML5 improve accessibility?**
   **Answer:**  
   HTML5 improves accessibility by introducing semantic elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) that provide better structure and meaning to web content. It also supports ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, which help screen readers and assistive technologies understand and navigate web pages more effectively.

---

### 11. **What is the difference between `<svg>` and `<canvas>`?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **SVG**: Scalable Vector Graphics is an XML-based vector image format for 2D graphics. It is resolution-independent and supports event handlers, making it ideal for interactive graphics.
   - **Canvas**: A bitmap-based element that uses JavaScript to draw graphics. It is resolution-dependent and better suited for rendering complex visuals like games or animations.

---

### 12. **What is the purpose of the `<progress>` and `<meter>` elements?**
   **Answer:**  
   - **`<progress>`**: Represents the completion progress of a task (e.g., file upload).
   - **`<meter>`**: Represents a scalar measurement within a known range (e.g., disk usage).

   Example:
   ```html
   <progress value="70" max="100"></progress>
   <meter value="3" min="0" max="10"></meter>
   ```

---

### 13. **What is the Geolocation API in HTML5?**
   **Answer:**  
   The Geolocation API allows websites to access the user's geographical location (with their permission). It is commonly used in mapping applications or location-based services.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
       console.log("Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude);
       console.log("Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude);
   });
   ```

---

### 14. **What is the purpose of the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `<details>` element creates a collapsible section of content, and the `<summary>` element provides a visible heading for the section.

   Example:
   ```html
   <details>
       <summary>Click to expand</summary>
       <p>This is the hidden content.</p>
   </details>
   ```

---

### 15. **How do you validate forms in HTML5?**
   **Answer:**  
   HTML5 provides built-in form validation using attributes like `required`, `pattern`, `min`, `max`, and `type`. For example:
   ```html
   <input type="email" required placeholder="Enter your email">
   <input type="number" min="1" max="100" required>
   ```

   Custom validation can also be implemented using JavaScript.

### 16. **What is the purpose of the `<main>` element in HTML5?**
   **Answer:**  
   The `<main>` element represents the main content of a document. It should contain content that is unique to the document and not repeated across other pages (e.g., sidebars, navigation links). There should only be one `<main>` element per page.

   Example:

     - `<b>` makes text **bold** without implying any importance.  
     - `<i>` makes text *italic* without implying any emphasis.  
   - `<strong>` and `<em>` are semantic tags:  
     - `<strong>` indicates that the text is **important** or has strong emphasis.  
     - `<em>` indicates that the text should be *emphasized* (e.g., for stress or tone).  

   Example:
   ```html
   <p><b>This text is bold.</b> <strong>This text is important.</strong></p>
